<h1>Learning Portfolio</h1>

<h2>Introduction to Web Programming</h2>
<p>
    Web programming involves the development of websites using technologies
    such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This course introduces the fundamental
    concepts required to build a functional and well-structured website.
</p>

<h2>What I Have Learned</h2>

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>
    I learned how to structure a web page using HTML elements such as
    headings, paragraphs, lists and semantic tags.
</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>
    CSS is used to control the layout, colors and overall appearance of
    the website to improve user experience.
</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>
    Basic JavaScript is used to add interactivity such as button click events.
</p>

<button onclick="showMessage()">Click Me</button>

<h2>Learning Reflection</h2>
<p>
    Through this course, I gained a better understanding of how HTML, CSS
    and JavaScript work together to create a complete website. Although I
    faced challenges in understanding the structure at first, continuous
    practice helped me improve my skills and confidence in web programming.
