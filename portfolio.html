    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Web programming is the process of developing websites using technologies
        such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The course SCSV 1223 – Web Programming
        introduces the fundamental concepts required to design, develop and deploy
        a functional website.

    <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>

    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>
        Through this course, I learned how to structure web pages using HTML
        elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists and semantic tags. HTML
        provides the basic framework of a website.
    </p>

    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>
        CSS is used to control the appearance and layout of a website. I learned
        how to apply styles such as colors, fonts and spacing to improve readability
        and overall user experience.
    </p>

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
        Basic JavaScript was introduced to add simple interactivity to a website.
        Examples include button click events and alert messages.
    </p>

    <button onclick="showMessage()">Click Me</button>

    <h2>Learning Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout this course, I gained a better understanding of how HTML, CSS
        and JavaScript work together to create a complete website. Initially, I
        faced challenges in understanding the structure and organization of files.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, with continuous practice and guidance, I became more confident in
        developing web pages and deploying them online using GitHub Pages. This
        learning experience has enhanced my problem-solving skills and increased
        my interest in web development.
